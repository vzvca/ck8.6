<p class="level1">Specifies the prefix of a Tcl command to invoke to change the view in the widget associated with the scrollbar.  When a user requests a view change by manipulating the scrollbar, a Tcl command is invoked.  The actual command consists of this option followed by additional information as described later. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">scrollbar</span> command creates a new window (given by the <span Class="emphasis">pathName</span> argument) and makes it into a scrollbar widget. Additional options, described above, may be specified on the command line or in the option database to configure aspects of the scrollbar such as its colors, orientation, and relief. The <span Class="bold">scrollbar</span> command returns its <span Class="emphasis">pathName</span> argument. At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named <span Class="emphasis">pathName</span>, but <span Class="emphasis">pathName</span>&#39;s parent must exist. 
<p class="level0">A scrollbar is a widget that displays two arrows, one at each end of the scrollbar, and a <span Class="emphasis">slider</span> in the middle portion of the scrollbar. It provides information about what is visible in an <span Class="emphasis">associated window</span> that displays an document of some sort (such as a file being edited). The position and size of the slider indicate which portion of the document is visible in the associated window.  For example, if the slider in a vertical scrollbar covers the top third of the area between the two arrows, it means that the associated window displays the top third of its document. 
<p class="level0">Scrollbars can be used to adjust the view in the associated window by clicking or dragging with the mouse.  See the BINDINGS section below for details. 
<p class="level0"><a name="ELEMENTS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">ELEMENTS</h2>
<p class="level0">A scrollbar displays five elements, which are referred to in the widget commands for the scrollbar: 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">arrow1</span> The top or left arrow in the scrollbar. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">trough1</span> The region between the slider and <span Class="bold">arrow1</span>. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">slider</span> The rectangle that indicates what is visible in the associated widget. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">trough2</span> The region between the slider and <span Class="bold">arrow2</span>. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">arrow2</span> The bottom or right arrow in the scrollbar. 
<p class="level0"><a name="WIDGET"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">WIDGET COMMAND</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">scrollbar</span> command creates a new Tcl command whose name is <span Class="emphasis">pathName</span>.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on the widget.  It has the following general form: 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">pathName option </span>?<span Class="emphasis">arg arg ...</span>? <span Class="emphasis">Option</span> and the <span Class="emphasis">arg</span>s determine the exact behavior of the command.  The following commands are possible for scrollbar widgets: 
<p class="level0"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span Class="bold">activate</span> Marks the scrollbar as active, which causes it to be displayed as specified by the <span Class="bold">activeAttributes</span>, <span Class="bold">activeBackground</span> and <span Class="bold">activeForeground</span> options. 
<p class="level0"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span Class="bold">cget</span> <span Class="emphasis">option</span> Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <span Class="emphasis">option</span>. <span Class="emphasis">Option</span> may have any of the values accepted by the <span Class="bold">scrollbar</span> command. 
<p class="level0"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span Class="bold">configure</span> ?<span Class="emphasis">option</span>? ?<span Class="emphasis">value option value ...</span>? Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no <span Class="emphasis">option</span> is specified, returns a list describing all of the available options for <span Class="emphasis">pathName</span>. If <span Class="emphasis">option</span> is specified with no <span Class="emphasis">value</span>, then the command returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no <span Class="emphasis">option</span> is specified).  If one or more <span Class="emphasis">option-value</span> pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);  in this case the command returns an empty string. <span Class="emphasis">Option</span> may have any of the values accepted by the <span Class="bold">scrollbar</span> command. 
<p class="level0"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span Class="bold">deactivate</span> Marks the scrollbar as normal, which causes it to be displayed as specified by the <span Class="bold">attributes</span>, <span Class="bold">background</span> and <span Class="bold">foreground</span> options. 
<p class="level0"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span class="bold">fraction <span Class="emphasis">x y</span> Returns a real number between 0 and 1 indicating where the point given by <span Class="emphasis">x</span> and <span Class="emphasis">y</span> lies in the trough area of the scrollbar. The value 0 corresponds to the top or left of the trough, the value 1 corresponds to the bottom or right, 0.5 corresponds to the middle, and so on. <span Class="emphasis">X</span> and <span Class="emphasis">y</span> must be screen coordinates relative to the scrollbar widget. If <span Class="emphasis">x</span> and <span Class="emphasis">y</span> refer to a point outside the trough, the closest point in the trough is used. 
<p class="level0"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span Class="bold">get</span> Returns the scrollbar settings in the form of a list whose elements are the arguments to the most recent <span Class="bold">set</span> widget command. 
<p class="level0"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span Class="bold">identify</span> <span Class="emphasis">x y</span> Returns the name of the element under the point given by <span Class="emphasis">x</span> and <span Class="emphasis">y</span> (such as <span Class="bold">arrow1</span>), or an empty string if the point does not lie in any element of the scrollbar. <span Class="emphasis">X</span> and <span Class="emphasis">y</span> must be screen coordinates relative to the scrollbar widget. 
<p class="level0"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span Class="bold">set</span> <span Class="emphasis">first last</span> This command is invoked by the scrollbar&#39;s associated widget to tell the scrollbar about the current view in the widget. The command takes two arguments, each of which is a real fraction between 0 and 1. The fractions describe the range of the document that is visible in the associated widget. For example, if <span Class="emphasis">first</span> is 0.2 and <span Class="emphasis">last</span> is 0.4, it means that the first part of the document visible in the window is 20% of the way through the document, and the last visible part is 40% of the way through. 
<p class="level0"><a name="SCROLLING"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SCROLLING COMMANDS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">When the user interacts with the scrollbar, for example by dragging the slider, the scrollbar notifies the associated widget that it must change its view. The scrollbar makes the notification by evaluating a Tcl command generated from the scrollbar&#39;s <span Class="bold">-command</span> option. The command may take any of the following forms. In each case, <span Class="emphasis">prefix</span> is the contents of the <span Class="bold">-command</span> option, which usually has a form like <span Class="bold">.t yview</span> 
<p class="level0"><span class="emphasis">prefix <span class="bold">moveto <span Class="emphasis">fraction</span> <span Class="emphasis">Fraction</span> is a real number between 0 and 1. The widget should adjust its view so that the point given by <span Class="emphasis">fraction</span> appears at the beginning of the widget. If <span Class="emphasis">fraction</span> is 0 it refers to the beginning of the document.  1.0 refers to the end of the document, 0.333 refers to a point one-third of the way through the document, and so on. 
<p class="level0"><span class="emphasis">prefix <span class="bold">scroll <span class="emphasis">number <span Class="bold">unit</span> The widget should adjust its view by <span Class="emphasis">number</span> units. The units are defined in whatever way makes sense for the widget, such as characters or lines in a text widget. <span Class="emphasis">Number</span> is either 1, which means one unit should scroll off the top or left of the window, or -1, which means that one unit should scroll off the bottom or right of the window. 
<p class="level0"><span class="emphasis">prefix <span class="bold">scroll <span class="emphasis">number <span Class="bold">page</span> The widget should adjust its view by <span Class="emphasis">number</span> pages. It is up to the widget to define the meaning of a page;  typically it is slightly less than what fits in the window, so that there is a slight overlap between the old and new views. <span Class="emphasis">Number</span> is either 1, which means the next page should become visible, or -1, which means that the previous page should become visible. 
<p class="level0"><a name="BINDINGS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">BINDINGS</h2>
<p class="level0">Ck automatically creates class bindings for scrollbars that give them the following default behavior. If the behavior is different for vertical and horizontal scrollbars, the horizontal behavior is described in parentheses. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="1"></a><span class="nroffip">[1]</span> 
<p class="level1">Pressing button 1 over <span Class="bold">arrow1</span> causes the view in the associated widget to shift up (left) by one unit so that the document appears to move down (right) one unit. 
<p class="level0"><a name="2"></a><span class="nroffip">[2]</span> 
<p class="level1">Pressing button 1 over <span Class="bold">trough1</span> causes the view in the associated widget to shift up (left) by one screenful so that the document appears to move down (right) one screenful. 
<p class="level0"><a name="3"></a><span class="nroffip">[3]</span> 
<p class="level1">Pressing button 1 over <span Class="bold">trough2</span> causes the view in the associated widget to shift down (right) by one screenful so that the document appears to move up (left) one screenful. 
<p class="level0"><a name="4"></a><span class="nroffip">[4]</span> 
<p class="level1">Pressing button 1 over <span Class="bold">arrow2</span> causes the view in the associated widget to shift down (right) by one unit so that the document appears to move up (left) one unit. 
<p class="level0"><a name="5"></a><span class="nroffip">[5]</span> 
<p class="level1">In vertical scrollbars the Up and Down keys have the same behavior as mouse clicks over <span Class="bold">arrow1</span> and <span Class="bold">arrow2</span>, respectively. In horizontal scrollbars these keys have no effect. 
<p class="level0"><a name="6"></a><span class="nroffip">[6]</span> 
<p class="level1">In horizontal scrollbars the Left and Right keys have the same behavior as mouse clicks over <span Class="bold">arrow1</span> and <span Class="bold">arrow2</span>, respectively. In vertical scrollbars these keys have no effect.
