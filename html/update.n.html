<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">This command is used to bring the entire application world ``up to date.&#39;&#39; It flushes all pending output to the display,  waits for the server to process that output and return errors or events, handles all pending events of any sort (including when-idle handlers), and repeats this set of operations until there are no pending events, no pending when-idle handlers, no pending output to the server, and no operations still outstanding at the server.   
<p class="level0">If the <span Class="bold">idletasks</span> keyword is specified as an argument to the command, then no new events or errors are processed;  only when-idle idlers are invoked. This causes operations that are normally deferred, such as display updates and window layout calculations, to be performed immediately. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">update idletasks</span> command is useful in scripts where changes have been made to the application&#39;s state and you want those changes to appear on the display immediately, rather than waiting for the script to complete.  Most display updates are performed as idle handlers, so <span Class="bold">update idletasks</span> will cause them to run. However, there are some kinds of updates that only happen in response to events, such as those triggered by window size changes; these updates will not occur in <span Class="bold">update idletasks</span>. 
<p class="level0">If the <span Class="bold">screen</span> keyword is specified as an argument to the command, then the entire screen is repainted from scratch without handling any other events. This is useful if the terminal&#39;s screen has been garbled by another process. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">update</span> command with no options is useful in scripts where you are performing a long-running computation but you still want the application to respond to user interactions;  if you occasionally call <span Class="bold">update</span> then user input will be processed during the next call to <span Class="bold">update</span>.
