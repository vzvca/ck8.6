<p class="level1">Specifies one of two states for the text:  <span Class="bold">normal</span> or <span Class="bold">disabled</span>. If the text is disabled then characters may not be inserted or deleted and no insertion cursor will be displayed, even if the input focus is in the widget.

Command-Line Switch:	<span class="bold">-tabs</span>
</pre>

<p class="level1">
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">Specifies a set of tab stops for the window.  The option&#39;s value consists of a list of screen distances giving the positions of the tab stops.  Each position may optionally be followed in the next list element by one of the keywords <span Class="bold">left</span>, <span Class="bold">right</span>, <span Class="bold">center</span>, or <span Class="bold">numeric</span>, which specifies how to justify text relative to the tab stop.  <span Class="bold">Left</span> is the default; it causes the text following the tab character to be positioned with its left edge at the tab position.  <span Class="bold">Right</span> means that the right edge of the text following the tab character is positioned at the tab position, and <span Class="bold">center</span> means that the text is centered at the tab position. <span Class="bold">Numeric</span> means that the decimal point in the text is positioned at the tab position;  if there is no decimal point then the least significant digit of the number is positioned just to the left of the tab position;  if there is no number in the text then the text is right-justified at the tab position. For example, <span Class="bold">-tabs {2 left 4 6 center}</span> creates three tab stops at two-column intervals;  the first two use left justification and the third uses center justification. If the list of tab stops does not have enough elements to cover all of the tabs in a text line, then Ck extrapolates new tab stops using the spacing and alignment from the last tab stop in the list. The value of the <span Class="bold">tabs</span> option may be overridden by <span Class="bold">-tabs</span> options in tags. If no <span Class="bold">-tabs</span> option is specified, or if it is specified as an empty list, then Ck uses default tabs spaced every eight columns.

The value must be <span Class="bold">none</span> or <span Class="bold">char</span> or <span Class="bold">word</span>. A wrap mode of <span Class="bold">none</span> means that each line of text appears as exactly one line on the screen;  extra characters that don&#39;t fit on the screen are not displayed. In the other modes each line of text will be broken up into several screen lines if necessary to keep all the characters visible. In <span Class="bold">char</span> mode a screen line break may occur after any character; in <span Class="bold">word</span> mode a line break will only be made at word boundaries. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">text</span> command creates a new window (given by the <span Class="emphasis">pathName</span> argument) and makes it into a text widget. Additional options, described above, may be specified on the command line or in the option database to configure aspects of the text such as its colors and attributes. The <span Class="bold">text</span> command returns the path name of the new window. 
<p class="level0">A text widget displays one or more lines of text and allows that text to be edited. Text widgets support two different kinds of annotations on the text, called tags and marks. Tags allow different portions of the text to be displayed with different attributes and colors. See TAGS below for more details. 
<p class="level0">The second form of annotation consists of marks, which are floating markers in the text. Marks are used to keep track of various interesting positions in the text as it is edited. See MARKS below for more details. 
<p class="level0"><a name="INDICES"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">INDICES</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Many of the widget commands for texts take one or more indices as arguments. An index is a string used to indicate a particular place within a text, such as a place to insert characters or one endpoint of a range of characters to delete. Indices have the syntax 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">base modifier modifier modifier ...</span> 
<p class="level1">Where <span Class="emphasis">base</span> gives a starting point and the <span Class="emphasis">modifier</span>s adjust the index from the starting point (e.g. move forward or backward one character).  Every index must contain a <span Class="emphasis">base</span>, but the <span Class="emphasis">modifier</span>s are optional. 
<p class="level1">The <span Class="emphasis">base</span> for an index must have one of the following forms: 
<p class="level1"><span class="emphasis">line<span class="bold">.<span Class="emphasis">char</span> Indicates <span Class="emphasis">char</span>&#39;th character on line <span Class="emphasis">line</span>. Lines are numbered from 1 for consistency with other UNIX programs that use this numbering scheme. Within a line, characters are numbered from 0. 
<p class="level1"><span class="bold">@<span class="emphasis">x<span class="bold">,<span Class="emphasis">y</span> Indicates the character that covers the place whose x and y coordinates within the text&#39;s window are <span Class="emphasis">x</span> and <span Class="emphasis">y</span>. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">end</span> Indicates the end of the text (the character just after the last newline). 
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">mark</span> Indicates the character just after the mark whose name is <span Class="emphasis">mark</span>. 
<p class="level1"><span class="emphasis">tag<span Class="bold">.first</span> Indicates the first character in the text that has been tagged with <span Class="emphasis">tag</span>. This form generates an error if no characters are currently tagged with <span Class="emphasis">tag</span>. 
<p class="level1"><span class="emphasis">tag<span Class="bold">.last</span> Indicates the character just after the last one in the text that has been tagged with <span Class="emphasis">tag</span>. This form generates an error if no characters are currently tagged with <span Class="emphasis">tag</span>. 
<p class="level1">If modifiers follow the base index, each one of them must have one of the forms listed below.  Keywords such as <span Class="bold">chars</span> and <span Class="bold">wordend</span> may be abbreviated as long as the abbreviation is unambiguous. 
<p class="level1"><span class="bold">+ <span class="emphasis">count<span Class="bold"> chars</span> Adjust the index forward by <span Class="emphasis">count</span> characters, moving to later lines in the text if necessary.  If there are fewer than <span Class="emphasis">count</span> characters in the text after the current index, then set the index to the last character in the text. Spaces on either side of <span Class="emphasis">count</span> are optional. 
<p class="level1"><span class="bold">- <span class="emphasis">count<span Class="bold"> chars</span> Adjust the index backward by <span Class="emphasis">count</span> characters, moving to earlier lines in the text if necessary.  If there are fewer than <span Class="emphasis">count</span> characters in the text before the current index, then set the index to the first character in the text. Spaces on either side of <span Class="emphasis">count</span> are optional. 
<p class="level1"><span class="bold">+ <span class="emphasis">count<span Class="bold"> lines</span> Adjust the index forward by <span Class="emphasis">count</span> lines, retaining the same character position within the line.  If there are fewer than <span Class="emphasis">count</span> lines after the line containing the current index, then set the index to refer to the same character position on the last line of the text. Then, if the line is not long enough to contain a character at the indicated character position, adjust the character position to refer to the last character of the line (the newline). Spaces on either side of <span Class="emphasis">count</span> are optional. 
<p class="level1"><span class="bold">- <span class="emphasis">count<span Class="bold"> lines</span> Adjust the index backward by <span Class="emphasis">count</span> lines, retaining the same character position within the line.  If there are fewer than <span Class="emphasis">count</span> lines before the line containing the current index, then set the index to refer to the same character position on the first line of the text. Then, if the line is not long enough to contain a character at the indicated character position, adjust the character position to refer to the last character of the line (the newline). Spaces on either side of <span Class="emphasis">count</span> are optional. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">linestart</span> Adjust the index to refer to the first character on the line. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">lineend</span> Adjust the index to refer to the last character on the line (the newline). 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">wordstart</span> Adjust the index to refer to the first character of the word containing the current index.  A word consists of any number of adjacent characters that are letters, digits, or underscores, or a single character that is not one of these. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">wordend</span> Adjust the index to refer to the character just after the last one of the word containing the current index.  If the current index refers to the last character of the text then it is not modified. 
<p class="level1">If more than one modifier is present then they are applied in left-to-right order.  For example, the index ``<span Class="bold">end - 1 chars</span>&#39;&#39; refers to the next-to-last character in the text and ``<span Class="bold">insert wordstart - 1 c</span>&#39;&#39; refers to the character just before the first one in the word containing the insertion cursor. 
<p class="level1"><a name="TAGS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">TAGS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The first form of annotation in text widgets is a tag. A tag is a textual string that is associated with some of the characters in a text. Tags may contain arbitrary characters, but it is probably best to avoid using the the characters `` &#39;&#39; (space), <a class="bold" href="#">+</a>, or <span Class="bold">-</span>: these characters have special meaning in indices, so tags containing them can&#39;t be used as indices. There may be any number of tags associated with characters in a text. Each tag may refer to a single character, a range of characters, or several ranges of characters. An individual character may have any number of tags associated with it. 
<p class="level0">A priority order is defined among tags, and this order is used in implementing some of the tag-related functions described below. When a tag is defined (by associating it with characters or setting its display options to it), it is given a priority higher than any existing tag. The priority order of tags may be redefined using the ``<span class="emphasis">pathName <span Class="bold">tag raise</span>&#39;&#39; and ``<span class="emphasis">pathName <span Class="bold">tag lower</span>&#39;&#39; widget commands. 
<p class="level0">Tags serve two purposes in text widgets. First, they control the way information is displayed on the screen. By default, characters are displayed as determined by the <span Class="bold">background</span>, <span Class="bold">attributes</span>, and <span Class="bold">foreground</span> options for the text widget. However, display options may be associated with individual tags using the ``<span class="emphasis">pathName <span Class="bold">tag configure</span>&#39;&#39; widget command. If a character has been tagged, then the display options associated with the tag override the default display style. The following options are currently supported for tags: 
<p class="level0"><span class="bold">-attributes <span Class="emphasis">attrList</span> <span Class="emphasis">AttrList</span> specifies the attributes to use for characters associated with the tag. 
<p class="level0"><span class="bold">-background <span Class="emphasis">color</span> <span Class="emphasis">Color</span> specifies the background color to use for characters associated with the tag. 
<p class="level0"><span class="bold">-foreground <span Class="emphasis">color</span> <span Class="emphasis">Color</span> specifies the color to use when drawing text and other foreground information such as underlines. It may have any of the forms accepted by <span Class="bold">Tk_GetColor</span>. 
<p class="level0"><span class="bold">-justify <span Class="emphasis">justify</span> If the first character of a display line has a tag for which this option has been specified, then <span Class="emphasis">justify</span> determines how to justify the line. It must be one of <span Class="bold">left</span>, <span Class="bold">right</span>, or <span Class="bold">center</span>. If a line wraps, then the justification for each line on the display is determined by the first character of that display line. 
<p class="level0"><span class="bold">-lmargin1 <span Class="emphasis">columns</span> If the first character of a text line has a tag for which this option has been specified, then <span Class="emphasis">columns</span> specifies how much the line should be indented from the left edge of the window. If a line of text wraps, this option only applies to the first line on the display;  the <span Class="bold">-lmargin2</span> option controls the indentation for subsequent lines. 
<p class="level0"><span class="bold">-lmargin2 <span Class="emphasis">columns</span> If the first character of a display line has a tag for which this option has been specified, and if the display line is not the first for its text line (i.e., the text line has wrapped), then <span Class="emphasis">columns</span> specifies how much the line should be indented from the left edge of the window. This option is only used when wrapping is enabled, and it only applies to the second and later display lines for a text line. 
<p class="level0"><span class="bold">-rmargin <span Class="emphasis">columns</span> If the first character of a display line has a tag for which this option has been specified, then <span Class="emphasis">columns</span> specifies how wide a margin to leave between the end of the line and the right edge of the window. This option is only used when wrapping is enabled. If a text line wraps, the right margin for each line on the display is determined by the first character of that display line. 
<p class="level0"><span class="bold">-tabs <span Class="emphasis">tabList</span> <span Class="emphasis">TabList</span> specifies a set of tab stops in the same form as for the <span Class="bold">-tabs</span> option for the text widget.  This option only applies to a display line if it applies to the first character on that display line. If this option is specified as an empty string, it cancels the option, leaving it unspecified for the tag (the default). If the option is specified as a non-empty string that is an empty list, such as <span Class="bold">-tags0{0}</span>, then it requests default 8-character tabs as described for the <span Class="bold">tags</span> widget option. 
<p class="level0"><span class="bold">-wrap <span Class="emphasis">mode</span> <span Class="emphasis">Mode</span> specifies how to handle lines that are wider than the text&#39;s window. It has the same legal values as the <span Class="bold">-wrap</span> option for the text widget:  <span Class="bold">none</span>, <span Class="bold">char</span>, or <span Class="bold">word</span>. If this tag option is specified, it overrides the <span Class="bold">-wrap</span> option for the text widget. 
<p class="level0">If a character has several tags associated with it, and if their display options conflict, then the options of the highest priority tag are used. If a particular display option hasn&#39;t been specified for a particular tag, or if it is specified as an empty string, then that option will never be used;  the next-highest-priority tag&#39;s option will used instead. If no tag specifies a particular display option, then the default style for the widget will be used. 
<p class="level0">The second use for tags is in managing the selection. See THE SELECTION below. 
<p class="level0"><a name="MARKS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">MARKS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The second form of annotation in text widgets is a mark. Marks are used for remembering particular places in a text. They are something like tags, in that they have names and they refer to places in the file, but a mark isn&#39;t associated with particular characters. Instead, a mark is associated with the gap between two characters. Only a single position may be associated with a mark at any given time. If the characters around a mark are deleted the mark will still remain;  it will just have new neighbor characters. In contrast, if the characters containing a tag are deleted then the tag will no longer have an association with characters in the file. Marks may be manipulated with the ``<span class="emphasis">pathName <span Class="bold">mark</span>&#39;&#39; widget command, and their current locations may be determined by using the mark name as an index in widget commands. 
<p class="level0">Each mark also has a <span Class="emphasis">gravity</span>, which is either <span Class="bold">left</span> or <span Class="bold">right</span>. The gravity for a mark specifies what happens to the mark when text is inserted at the point of the mark. If a mark has left gravity, then the mark is treated as if it were attached to the character on its left, so the mark will remain to the left of any text inserted at the mark position. If the mark has right gravity, new text inserted at the mark position will appear to the right of the mark.  The gravity for a mark defaults to <span Class="bold">right</span>. 
<p class="level0">The name space for marks is different from that for tags:  the same name may be used for both a mark and a tag, but they will refer to different things. 
<p class="level0">Two marks have special significance. First, the mark <span Class="bold">insert</span> is associated with the insertion cursor, as described under THE INSERTION CURSOR below. Second, the mark <span Class="bold">current</span> is associated with the character closest to the mouse and is adjusted automatically to track the mouse position and any changes to the text in the widget (one exception:  <span Class="bold">current</span> is not updated in response to mouse motions if a mouse button is down;  the update will be deferred until all mouse buttons have been released). Neither of these special marks may be deleted. 
<p class="level0"><a name="THE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">THE SELECTION</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Selection support is implemented via tags. The <span Class="bold">sel</span> tag is automatically defined when a text widget is created, and it may not be deleted with the ``<span class="emphasis">pathName <span Class="bold">tag delete</span>&#39;&#39; widget command.  Furthermore, the <span Class="bold">selectBackground</span>, <span Class="bold">selectAttributes</span>, and <span Class="bold">selectForeground</span> options for the text widget are tied to the <span Class="bold">-background</span>, <span Class="bold">-attributes</span>, and <span Class="bold">-foreground</span> options for the <span Class="bold">sel</span> tag:  changes in either will automatically be reflected in the other. 
<p class="level0"><a name="THE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">THE INSERTION CURSOR</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The mark named <span Class="bold">insert</span> has special significance in text widgets. It is defined automatically when a text widget is created and it may not be unset with the ``<span class="emphasis">pathName <span Class="bold">mark unset</span>&#39;&#39; widget command. The <span Class="bold">insert</span> mark represents the position of the insertion cursor, and the insertion cursor will automatically be moved to this point whenever the text widget has the input focus. 
<p class="level0"><a name="WIDGET"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">WIDGET COMMAND</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">text</span> command creates a new Tcl command whose name is the same as the path name of the text&#39;s window.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on the widget.  It has the following general form: 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">pathName option </span>?<span Class="emphasis">arg arg ...</span>? <span Class="emphasis">PathName</span> is the name of the command, which is the same as the text widget&#39;s path name.  <span Class="emphasis">Option</span> and the <span Class="emphasis">arg</span>s determine the exact behavior of the command.  The following commands are possible for text widgets: 
<p class="level0"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span class="bold">bbox <span Class="emphasis">index</span> Returns a list of four elements describing the screen area of the character given by <span Class="emphasis">index</span>. The first two elements of the list give the x and y coordinates of the upper-left corner of the area occupied by the character, and the last two elements give the width and height of the area. If the character is not visible on the screen then the return value is an empty list. 
<p class="level0"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span Class="bold">cget</span> <span Class="emphasis">option</span> Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <span Class="emphasis">option</span>. <span Class="emphasis">Option</span> may have any of the values accepted by the <span Class="bold">text</span> command. 
<p class="level0"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span Class="bold">compare</span> <span Class="emphasis">index1 op index2</span> Compares the indices given by <span Class="emphasis">index1</span> and <span Class="emphasis">index2</span> according to the relational operator given by <span Class="emphasis">op</span>, and returns 1 if the relationship is satisfied and 0 if it isn&#39;t. <span Class="emphasis">Op</span> must be one of the operators &lt;, &lt;=, ==, &gt;=, &gt;, or !=. If <span Class="emphasis">op</span> is == then 1 is returned if the two indices refer to the same character, if <span Class="emphasis">op</span> is &lt; then 1 is returned if <span Class="emphasis">index1</span> refers to an earlier character in the text than <span Class="emphasis">index2</span>, and so on. 
<p class="level0"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span Class="bold">configure</span> ?<span Class="emphasis">option</span>? <span Class="emphasis">?value option value ...</span>? Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no <span Class="emphasis">option</span> is specified, returns a list describing all of the available options for <span Class="emphasis">pathName</span>. If <span Class="emphasis">option</span> is specified with no <span Class="emphasis">value</span>, then the command returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no <span Class="emphasis">option</span> is specified).  If one or more <span Class="emphasis">option-value</span> pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);  in this case the command returns an empty string. <span Class="emphasis">Option</span> may have any of the values accepted by the <span Class="bold">text</span> command. 
<p class="level0"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span Class="bold">debug </span>?<span Class="emphasis">boolean</span>? If <span Class="emphasis">boolean</span> is specified, then it must have one of the true or false values accepted by Tcl_GetBoolean. If the value is a true one then internal consistency checks will be turned on in the B-tree code associated with text widgets. If <span Class="emphasis">boolean</span> has a false value then the debugging checks will be turned off. In either case the command returns an empty string. If <span Class="emphasis">boolean</span> is not specified then the command returns <span Class="bold">on</span> or <span Class="bold">off</span> to indicate whether or not debugging is turned on. There is a single debugging switch shared by all text widgets:  turning debugging on or off in any widget turns it on or off for all widgets. For widgets with large amounts of text, the consistency checks may cause a noticeable slow-down. 
<p class="level0"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span class="bold">delete <span Class="emphasis">index1 </span>?<span Class="emphasis">index2</span>? Delete a range of characters from the text. If both <span Class="emphasis">index1</span> and <span Class="emphasis">index2</span> are specified, then delete all the characters starting with the one given by <span Class="emphasis">index1</span> and stopping just before <span Class="emphasis">index2</span> (i.e. the character at <span Class="emphasis">index2</span> is not deleted). If <span Class="emphasis">index2</span> doesn&#39;t specify a position later in the text than <span Class="emphasis">index1</span> then no characters are deleted. If <span Class="emphasis">index2</span> isn&#39;t specified then the single character at <span Class="emphasis">index1</span> is deleted. It is not allowable to delete characters in a way that would leave the text without a newline as the last character. The command returns an empty string. 
<p class="level0"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span class="bold">dlineinfo <span Class="emphasis">index</span> Returns a list with five elements describing the area occupied by the display line containing <span Class="emphasis">index</span>. The first two elements of the list give the x and y coordinates of the upper-left corner of the area occupied by the line, the third and fourth elements give the width and height of the area, and the fifth element gives the position of the baseline for the line (always zero). All of this information is measured in screen coordinates. If the current wrap mode is <span Class="bold">none</span> and the line extends beyond the boundaries of the window, the area returned reflects the entire area of the line, including the portions that are out of the window. If the line is shorter than the full width of the window then the area returned reflects just the portion of the line that is occupied by characters. If the display line containing <span Class="emphasis">index</span> is not visible on the screen then the return value is an empty list. 
<p class="level0"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span class="bold">get <span Class="emphasis">index1 </span>?<span Class="emphasis">index2</span>? Return a range of characters from the text. The return value will be all the characters in the text starting with the one whose index is <span Class="emphasis">index1</span> and ending just before the one whose index is <span Class="emphasis">index2</span> (the character at <span Class="emphasis">index2</span> will not be returned). If <span Class="emphasis">index2</span> is omitted then the single character at <span Class="emphasis">index1</span> is returned. If there are no characters in the specified range (e.g. <span Class="emphasis">index1</span> is past the end of the file or <span Class="emphasis">index2</span> is less than or equal to <span Class="emphasis">index1</span>) then an empty string is returned. 
<p class="level0"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span class="bold">index <span Class="emphasis">index</span> Returns the position corresponding to <span Class="emphasis">index</span> in the form <span Class="emphasis">line.char</span> where <span Class="emphasis">line</span> is the line number and <span Class="emphasis">char</span> is the character number. <span Class="emphasis">Index</span> may have any of the forms described under INDICES above. 
<p class="level0"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span class="bold">insert <span Class="emphasis">index chars </span>?<span Class="emphasis">tagList chars tagList ...</span>? Inserts all of the <span Class="emphasis">chars</span> arguments just before the character at <span Class="emphasis">index</span>. If <span Class="emphasis">index</span> refers to the end of the text (the character after the last newline) then the new text is inserted just before the last newline instead. If there is a single <span Class="emphasis">chars</span> argument and no <span Class="emphasis">tagList</span>, then the new text will receive any tags that are present on both the character before and the character after the insertion point; if a tag is present on only one of these characters then it will not be applied to the new text. If <span Class="emphasis">tagList</span> is specified then it consists of a list of tag names;  the new characters will receive all of the tags in this list and no others, regardless of the tags present around the insertion point. If multiple <span Class="emphasis">chars</span>-<span Class="emphasis">tagList</span> argument pairs are present, they produce the same effect as if a separate <span Class="bold">insert</span> widget command had been issued for each pair, in order. The last <span Class="emphasis">tagList</span> argument may be omitted. 
<p class="level0"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span class="bold">mark <span Class="emphasis">option </span>?<span Class="emphasis">arg arg ...</span>? This command is used to manipulate marks.  The exact behavior of the command depends on the <span Class="emphasis">option</span> argument that follows the <span Class="bold">mark</span> argument.  The following forms of the command are currently supported: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span class="bold">mark gravity <span Class="emphasis">markName</span> ?<span Class="emphasis">direction</span>? If <span Class="emphasis">direction</span> is not specified, returns <span Class="bold">left</span> or <span Class="bold">right</span> to indicate which of its adjacent characters <span Class="emphasis">markName</span> is attached to. If <span Class="emphasis">direction</span> is specified, it must be <span Class="bold">left</span> or <span Class="bold">right</span>; the gravity of <span Class="emphasis">markName</span> is set to the given value. 
<p class="level1"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span Class="bold">mark names</span> Returns a list whose elements are the names of all the marks that are currently set. 
<p class="level1"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span class="bold">mark set <span Class="emphasis">markName index</span> Sets the mark named <span Class="emphasis">markName</span> to a position just before the character at <span Class="emphasis">index</span>. If <span Class="emphasis">markName</span> already exists, it is moved from its old position; if it doesn&#39;t exist, a new mark is created. This command returns an empty string. 
<p class="level1"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span class="bold">mark unset <span Class="emphasis">markName </span>?<span Class="emphasis">markName markName ...</span>? Remove the mark corresponding to each of the <span Class="emphasis">markName</span> arguments. The removed marks will not be usable in indices and will not be returned by future calls to ``<span class="emphasis">pathName <span Class="bold">mark names</span>&#39;&#39;. This command returns an empty string. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span Class="bold">search </span>?<span Class="emphasis">switches</span>? <span Class="emphasis">pattern index </span>?<span Class="emphasis">stopIndex</span>? Searches the text in <span Class="emphasis">pathName</span> starting at <span Class="emphasis">index</span> for a range of characters that matches <span Class="emphasis">pattern</span>. If a match is found, the index of the first character in the match is returned as result;  otherwise an empty string is returned. One or more of the following switches (or abbreviations thereof) may be specified to control the search: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-forwards</span> The search will proceed forward through the text, finding the first matching range starting at a position later than <span Class="emphasis">index</span>. This is the default. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-backwards</span> The search will proceed backward through the text, finding the matching range closest to <span Class="emphasis">index</span> whose first character is before <span Class="emphasis">index</span>. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-exact</span> Use exact matching:  the characters in the matching range must be identical to those in <span Class="emphasis">pattern</span>. This is the default. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-regexp</span> Treat <span Class="emphasis">pattern</span> as a regular expression and match it against the text using the rules for regular expressions (see the <span Class="bold">regexp</span> command for details). 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-nocase</span> Ignore case differences between the pattern and the text. 
<p class="level1"><span class="bold">-count<span Class="emphasis"> varName</span> The argument following <span Class="bold">-count</span> gives the name of a variable; if a match is found, the number of characters in the matching range will be stored in the variable. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">--</span> This switch has no effect except to terminate the list of switches: the next argument will be treated as <span Class="emphasis">pattern</span> even if it starts with <span Class="bold">-</span>. 
<p class="level1">The matching range must be entirely within a single line of text. For regular expression matching the newlines are removed from the ends of the lines before matching:  use the <a class="bold" href="#">$</a> feature in regular expressions to match the end of a line. For exact matching the newlines are retained. If <span Class="emphasis">stopIndex</span> is specified, the search stops at that index: for forward searches, no match at or after <span Class="emphasis">stopIndex</span> will be considered;  for backward searches, no match earlier in the text than <span Class="emphasis">stopIndex</span> will be considered. If <span Class="emphasis">stopIndex</span> is omitted, the entire text will be searched: when the beginning or end of the text is reached, the search continues at the other end until the starting location is reached again;  if <span Class="emphasis">stopIndex</span> is specified, no wrap-around will occur. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span class="bold">see <span Class="emphasis">index</span> Adjusts the view in the window so that the character given by <span Class="emphasis">index</span> is visible. If <span Class="emphasis">index</span> is already visible then the command does nothing. If <span Class="emphasis">index</span> is a short distance out of view, the command adjusts the view just enough to make <span Class="emphasis">index</span> visible at the edge of the window. If <span Class="emphasis">index</span> is far out of view, then the command centers <span Class="emphasis">index</span> in the window. 
<p class="level0"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span class="bold">tag <span Class="emphasis">option </span>?<span Class="emphasis">arg arg ...</span>? This command is used to manipulate tags.  The exact behavior of the command depends on the <span Class="emphasis">option</span> argument that follows the <span Class="bold">tag</span> argument.  The following forms of the command are currently supported: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span class="bold">tag add <span Class="emphasis">tagName index1 </span>?<span Class="emphasis">index2 index1 index2 ...</span>? Associate the tag <span Class="emphasis">tagName</span> with all of the characters starting with <span Class="emphasis">index1</span> and ending just before <span Class="emphasis">index2</span> (the character at <span Class="emphasis">index2</span> isn&#39;t tagged). A single command may contain any number of <span Class="emphasis">index1</span>-<span Class="emphasis">index2</span> pairs. If the last <span Class="emphasis">index2</span> is omitted then the single character at <span Class="emphasis">index1</span> is tagged. If there are no characters in the specified range (e.g. <span Class="emphasis">index1</span> is past the end of the file or <span Class="emphasis">index2</span> is less than or equal to <span Class="emphasis">index1</span>) then the command has no effect. 
<p class="level1"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span Class="bold">tag cget</span> <span Class="emphasis">tagName option</span> This command returns the current value of the option named <span Class="emphasis">option</span> associated with the tag given by <span Class="emphasis">tagName</span>. <span Class="emphasis">Option</span> may have any of the values accepted by the <span Class="bold">tag configure</span> widget command. 
<p class="level1"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span class="bold">tag configure <span Class="emphasis">tagName</span> ?<span Class="emphasis">option</span>? ?<span Class="emphasis">value</span>? ?<span Class="emphasis">option value ...</span>? This command is similar to the <span Class="bold">configure</span> widget command except that it modifies options associated with the tag given by <span Class="emphasis">tagName</span> instead of modifying options for the overall text widget. If no <span Class="emphasis">option</span> is specified, the command returns a list describing all of the available options for <span Class="emphasis">tagName</span>. If <span Class="emphasis">option</span> is specified with no <span Class="emphasis">value</span>, then the command returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no <span Class="emphasis">option</span> is specified). If one or more <span Class="emphasis">option-value</span> pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given option(s) to have the given value(s) in <span Class="emphasis">tagName</span>; in this case the command returns an empty string. See TAGS above for details on the options available for tags. 
<p class="level1"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span class="bold">tag delete <span Class="emphasis">tagName </span>?<span Class="emphasis">tagName ...</span>? Deletes all tag information for each of the <span Class="emphasis">tagName</span> arguments. The command removes the tags from all characters in the file and also deletes any other information associated with the tags, such as bindings and display information. The command returns an empty string. 
<p class="level1"><span class="emphasis">pathName<span class="bold"> tag lower <span Class="emphasis">tagName </span>?<span Class="emphasis">belowThis</span>? Changes the priority of tag <span Class="emphasis">tagName</span> so that it is just lower in priority than the tag whose name is <span Class="emphasis">belowThis</span>. If <span Class="emphasis">belowThis</span> is omitted, then <span Class="emphasis">tagName</span>&#39;s priority is changed to make it lowest priority of all tags. 
<p class="level1"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span Class="bold">tag names </span>?<span Class="emphasis">index</span>? Returns a list whose elements are the names of all the tags that are active at the character position given by <span Class="emphasis">index</span>. If <span Class="emphasis">index</span> is omitted, then the return value will describe all of the tags that exist for the text (this includes all tags that have been named in a ``<span class="emphasis">pathName <span Class="bold">tag</span>&#39;&#39; widget command but haven&#39;t been deleted by a ``<span class="emphasis">pathName <span Class="bold">tag delete</span>&#39;&#39; widget command, even if no characters are currently marked with the tag). The list will be sorted in order from lowest priority to highest priority. 
<p class="level1"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span class="bold">tag nextrange <span Class="emphasis">tagName index1 </span>?<span Class="emphasis">index2</span>? This command searches the text for a range of characters tagged with <span Class="emphasis">tagName</span> where the first character of the range is no earlier than the character at <span Class="emphasis">index1</span> and no later than the character just before <span Class="emphasis">index2</span> (a range starting at <span Class="emphasis">index2</span> will not be considered). If several matching ranges exist, the first one is chosen. The command&#39;s return value is a list containing two elements, which are the index of the first character of the range and the index of the character just after the last one in the range. If no matching range is found then the return value is an empty string. If <span Class="emphasis">index2</span> is not given then it defaults to the end of the text. 
<p class="level1"><span class="emphasis">pathName<span class="bold"> tag raise <span Class="emphasis">tagName </span>?<span Class="emphasis">aboveThis</span>? Changes the priority of tag <span Class="emphasis">tagName</span> so that it is just higher in priority than the tag whose name is <span Class="emphasis">aboveThis</span>. If <span Class="emphasis">aboveThis</span> is omitted, then <span Class="emphasis">tagName</span>&#39;s priority is changed to make it highest priority of all tags. 
<p class="level1"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span class="bold">tag ranges <span Class="emphasis">tagName</span> Returns a list describing all of the ranges of text that have been tagged with <span Class="emphasis">tagName</span>. The first two elements of the list describe the first tagged range in the text, the next two elements describe the second range, and so on. The first element of each pair contains the index of the first character of the range, and the second element of the pair contains the index of the character just after the last one in the range. If there are no characters tagged with <span Class="emphasis">tag</span> then an empty string is returned. 
<p class="level1"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span class="bold">tag remove <span Class="emphasis">tagName index1 </span>?<span Class="emphasis">index2 index1 index2 ...</span>? Remove the tag <span Class="emphasis">tagName</span> from all of the characters starting at <span Class="emphasis">index1</span> and ending just before <span Class="emphasis">index2</span> (the character at <span Class="emphasis">index2</span> isn&#39;t affected). A single command may contain any number of <span Class="emphasis">index1</span>-<span Class="emphasis">index2</span> pairs. If the last <span Class="emphasis">index2</span> is omitted then the single character at <span Class="emphasis">index1</span> is tagged. If there are no characters in the specified range (e.g. <span Class="emphasis">index1</span> is past the end of the file or <span Class="emphasis">index2</span> is less than or equal to <span Class="emphasis">index1</span>) then the command has no effect. This command returns an empty string. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span class="bold">xview <span Class="emphasis">option args</span> This command is used to query and change the horizontal position of the text in the widget&#39;s window.  It can take any of the following forms: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span Class="bold">xview</span> Returns a list containing two elements. Each element is a real fraction between 0 and 1;  together they describe the portion of the document&#39;s horizontal span that is visible in the window. For example, if the first element is .2 and the second element is .6, 20% of the text is off-screen to the left, the middle 40% is visible in the window, and 40% of the text is off-screen to the right. The fractions refer only to the lines that are actually visible in the window:  if the lines in the window are all very short, so that they are entirely visible, the returned fractions will be 0 and 1, even if there are other lines in the text that are much wider than the window. These are the same values passed to scrollbars via the <span Class="bold">-xscrollcommand</span> option. 
<p class="level1"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span class="bold">xview moveto<span Class="emphasis"> fraction</span> Adjusts the view in the window so that <span Class="emphasis">fraction</span> of the horizontal span of the text is off-screen to the left. <span Class="emphasis">Fraction</span> is a fraction between 0 and 1. 
<p class="level1"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span class="bold">xview scroll <span Class="emphasis">number what</span> This command shifts the view in the window left or right according to <span Class="emphasis">number</span> and <span Class="emphasis">what</span>. <span Class="emphasis">Number</span> must be an integer. <span Class="emphasis">What</span> must be either <span Class="bold">units</span> or <span Class="bold">pages</span> or an abbreviation of one of these. If <span Class="emphasis">what</span> is <span Class="bold">units</span>, the view adjusts left or right by <span Class="emphasis">number</span> average-width characters on the display;  if it is <span Class="bold">pages</span> then the view adjusts by <span Class="emphasis">number</span> screenfuls. If <span Class="emphasis">number</span> is negative then characters farther to the left become visible;  if it is positive then characters farther to the right become visible. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span class="bold">yview <span Class="emphasis">?args</span>? This command is used to query and change the vertical position of the text in the widget&#39;s window. It can take any of the following forms: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span Class="bold">yview</span> Returns a list containing two elements, both of which are real fractions between 0 and 1. The first element gives the position of the first character in the top line in the window, relative to the text as a whole (0.5 means it is halfway through the text, for example). The second element gives the position of the character just after the last one in the bottom line of the window, relative to the text as a whole. These are the same values passed to scrollbars via the <span Class="bold">-yscrollcommand</span> option. 
<p class="level1"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span class="bold">yview moveto<span Class="emphasis"> fraction</span> Adjusts the view in the window so that the character given by <span Class="emphasis">fraction</span> appears on the top line of the window. <span Class="emphasis">Fraction</span> is a fraction between 0 and 1;  0 indicates the first character in the text, 0.33 indicates the character one-third the way through the text, and so on. 
<p class="level1"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span class="bold">yview scroll <span Class="emphasis">number what</span> This command adjust the view in the window up or down according to <span Class="emphasis">number</span> and <span Class="emphasis">what</span>. <span Class="emphasis">Number</span> must be an integer. <span Class="emphasis">What</span> must be either <span Class="bold">units</span> or <span Class="bold">pages</span>. If <span Class="emphasis">what</span> is <span Class="bold">units</span>, the view adjusts up or down by <span Class="emphasis">number</span> lines on the display;  if it is <span Class="bold">pages</span> then the view adjusts by <span Class="emphasis">number</span> screenfuls. If <span Class="emphasis">number</span> is negative then earlier positions in the text become visible;  if it is positive then later positions in the text become visible. 
<p class="level1"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span Class="bold">yview </span>?<span Class="bold">-pickplace</span>? <span Class="emphasis">index</span> Changes the view in the widget&#39;s window to make <span Class="emphasis">index</span> visible. If the <span Class="bold">-pickplace</span> option isn&#39;t specified then <span Class="emphasis">index</span> will appear at the top of the window. If <span Class="bold">-pickplace</span> is specified then the widget chooses where <span Class="emphasis">index</span> appears in the window: 
<p class="level2">
<p class="level1"><a name="1"></a><span class="nroffip">[1]</span> 
<p class="level2">If <span Class="emphasis">index</span> is already visible somewhere in the window then the command does nothing. 
<p class="level1"><a name="2"></a><span class="nroffip">[2]</span> 
<p class="level2">If <span Class="emphasis">index</span> is only a few lines off-screen above the window then it will be positioned at the top of the window.

<p class="level2">Otherwise, <span Class="emphasis">index</span> will be centered in the window. 
<p class="level2">The <span Class="bold">-pickplace</span> option has been obsoleted by the <span Class="bold">see</span> widget command (<span Class="bold">see</span> handles both x- and y-motion to make a location visible, whereas <span Class="bold">-pickplace</span> only handles motion in y). 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span class="emphasis">pathName <span class="bold">yview <span Class="emphasis">number</span> This command makes the first character on the line after the one given by <span Class="emphasis">number</span> visible at the top of the window. <span Class="emphasis">Number</span> must be an integer.

<p class="level1"><a name="PERFORMANCE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">PERFORMANCE ISSUES</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Text widgets should run efficiently under a variety of conditions.  The text widget uses about 2-3 bytes of main memory for each byte of text, so texts containing a megabyte or more should be practical on most workstations. Text is represented internally with a modified B-tree structure that makes operations relatively efficient even with large texts. Tags are included in the B-tree structure in a way that allows tags to span large ranges or have many disjoint smaller ranges without loss of efficiency. Marks are also implemented in a way that allows large numbers of marks. The only known mode of operation where a text widget may not run efficiently is if it has a very large number of different tags. Hundreds of tags should be fine, or even a thousand, but tens of thousands of tags will make texts consume a lot of memory and run slowly.
